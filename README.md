# keyframes

Many times CSS can works very well. When we need to modify the style sheet at runtime, I tend to operate or style instead of *css in js*. Because such a shema is not zero runtime.

But when I need to use variable in *@keyframes*, use js to generator would be very nice.

This idea is base on [emotion]('https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion'), but sample implementation, if you want to use it in production; It's better to use [emotion]('https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion') directly.

## development

```javascript
git clone git@github.com:pjshy/keyframes.git

cd keyframes

yarn
or
npm install

yarn dev
or
npm run dev
```
